# Work Orders

Today I was contracted to replace two failed stepper motors within the instrument panel of a *2005 Chevy 2500HD Duramax*.
These stepper motors are known for failing and the customer had already found the neccessary replacement motors online. The new motors are of unknown origin to me.

### Process

I applied solder flux to the board and used the hot air station to bring everything up to heat. Then came using the soldering iron and solder sucker to remove all of the solder in the through-hole posts. There are 4 for each motor.

When reinstalling the new motor I bend each of these through-hole posts slightly to ensure the motor stays attached to the board. I add more solder flux to clean out the post sites, and then solder them into place.

This entire process only took about 20 minutes. The customer already had the dash disassembled for me on arrival.
