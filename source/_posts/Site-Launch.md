# Hello

This site was built using [Hexo](https://hexo.io), with hexo-theme [LX](https://github.com/blleng/hexo-theme-lx).
Thanks [Leng](https://github.com/blleng)!

Hexo is a light weight NPM package that runs within the NodeJS environment. I used this package because my machine is already setup for working within the environment. The other option was to use Jekyll and I didn't find that option as beneficial.

For hosting and domain name I am using [GitHub-Pages](https://pages.github.com) since they generously provide free hosting. I am using built-in GitHub Actions for building and deployment.

## The purpose of this site.

This site is an archive of work, demonstrating talents to potential agents and business partners.
I am looking for work! Need some support? Contact me here - <brahancock@gmail.com> -
