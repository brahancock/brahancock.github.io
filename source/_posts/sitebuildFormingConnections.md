# Forming Connections

I partnered with Tiff to develop a website to help with hosting a talent show. The website was built with the website building platform [Wix](https://www.wix.com).
We chose to use this platform to save on development and hosting costs. Thanks to this, we got this site built fast. Tiffs website features a page displaying Talent Show Acts she can modify through a CMS portal.
This gives her the ability to edit and manage content on this page without a technical background. I created a few PDF files to help her navigate this process.
The site also features a ticket and event details portal to allow her to easily manage ticket prices, seating, and event details. Domain name registration and deployment is built in by Wix with a basic package plan of 17$ billed monthly. A very convienent price and process for a developer using this system. We made quick work of generating content and agreeing on a design by customizing one of the many templates Wix offers.

### Appreciation

I donated half of my time spent working on this project because it benefits Tiff's non-profit organization with forming connections between autistic actors. I am very proud of Tiff for donating the time she has in aid and care for this group. You rock Tiff!
