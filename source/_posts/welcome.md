## This website was built using Hexo and GitHub Pages
***Hexo*** is a static blog style website generator and uses the *NodeJS* runtime environment to execute *Javascript*. It is installed using the node package manager service.
I used Hexo because it integrates with GitHub Pages quickly and easily. ***GitHub Pages*** is used because of their generous free hosting. You can view the code to this website by visting this [repository](https://github.com/brahancock/brahancock.github.io).
